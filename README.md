## What does we learn from doing this project?
From doing this project, we had learned about **Graphic User Interface (GUI)** by using Java Swing and also learned about other commands to use in JFrame Form. For example, ...
- Command for close one frame and open another frame.
```
new GameAbout().setVisible(true);
dispose();
```
- Commands for set some properties of a frame

**Example:** to set title of frame
```
setTitle("Igpay Altinlay [Pig Latin]");
```
**Example:** to set that the frame can be resize or not
 ```
setResizable(false);
```
**Example:** to set size of the frame
```
setPreferredSize(new java.awt.Dimension(600, 522));
```
**Example:** Commands for get input from players by using JTextField then get input from Text Field and change it into String to use.
```
JTextField ezAns = new JTextField();
String inputAns = ezAns.getText();
```

**We also used knowledge from the lesson in the class, those areâ€¦**
- Use **Encapsulation** to protect some of our data.
```
static private String[] qEasy;
```
- **Read data from file** and use **List** for keep questions, choices and answers.
```
static String menuFileEasy = "qData/easyQandA.txt";
static private String itemsEasy[];
static Random rand = new Random();

static void setQEasy() {
    ClassLoader loader = Question.class.getClassLoader();
    ArrayList<String> easySet = new ArrayList<>();
    InputStream in = loader.getResourceAsStream(menuFileEasy);
    if (in == null) {
        System.out.println("Could not access file " + menuFileEasy);
        return;
    }
    Scanner scanFile = new Scanner(in);
    while (scanFile.hasNextLine()) {
        String line = scanFile.nextLine();
        if (line.startsWith("#") || line.startsWith(" #") || line.equals("")) {
            continue;
        }
        easySet.add(line);
    }
    scanFile.close();

    itemsEasy = new String[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < itemsEasy.length; i++) {
        int r = rand.nextInt(easySet.size() - 1) + 1;
        itemsEasy[i] = easySet.get(r);
        easySet.remove(r);
    }
}
```
- Use **Data Types in Java** for help to decide types of variables in project.
```
static String inAns;
static int score = 0;
static boolean check;
```
- Use **Inheritance** to use methods from other classes.
**Example:** QA_Easy class inherit JFrame class.
```
public class QA_Easy extends javax.swing.JFrame
```
- Use **Object** lesson to create JButton objects, JLabel objects, JTextField objects and also JFrame objects.
```
JTextField ezAns = new JTextField();
JButton nxtBtn = new JButton();
JLabel ezBG = new JLabel();
```
